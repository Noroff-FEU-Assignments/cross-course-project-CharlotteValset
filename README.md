<h1>Square Eyes - cross-course assignment</h1>

This is a school assignment where I am learning to create a website from Design1-course with HTML, CSS and JS.

**<h2>Java Script update</h2>**

The website has now been updated and has api calls that have been implemented with Java Script.

**<h3>Introduction</h3>**
In this report I will talk about how I used HTML and CSS to create a responsive website named, SquareEyes, and the challenges I met along the way and what I learned from this assignment.

**<h3>Building the website</h3>**
Code editor used: Visual Studio Code

I started to write all the HTML for all the pages, making sure I got all the content included.
Then I continued to style the pages with CSS, getting the right layout for the pages, font-family, sizes on images, colours used and so on...
Next step was to make the website responsive to other screen sizes, this was achieved by using media queries.The website was checked for errors through W3C - Markup Validation Service and Wave - Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools and it is now “error-free”.
The website was tested on different browsers and screen sizes by peers in my class, friends and family. Adjustments were made based on their feedback.

**<h3>Challenges</h3>**
This assignment had a lot of ups and downs. The most challenges I had was trying to get the layout right on all the elements, and to make it responsive and looking good on all screen sizes.
I had initially designed a slideshow for the “Most watched/Newly added” film-covers on the mobile version, but after a tip from one of our teachers, I decided to change this to a column view as it is more comfortable to scroll downwards as apposed to left and right.
The grey highlighted background which is smaller than the images on some of the pages, was a really difficult thing to create. But I eventually found a way to make it and I am happy with the results.
On the “contact page” the layout for the desktop and mobile was a bit tricky to get right. I am hoping that with more knowledge and understanding over these years at Noroff will provide me with a skillset to create something like this in even better ways.

**<h3>What I have learned</h3>**
I have learned during this assignment that it takes a lot of trying and failing to get things right. It is a never-ending journey, as there is always something that could be improved.
For some reason, I forgot to do the mobile-first approach, and I think that gave me more trouble when I was trying to make the website responsive to all screen sizes with media queries. So, for my next project, I am going to take this assignment as a lesson learned and remember to start with the mobile first.

**<h3>Conlusion</h3>**
It has been a fun adventure into this new (for me at least) world of front-end development. Even though it can feel hopeless sometimes when nothing goes right, I have enjoyed every second of this assignment and cant wait to learn more and get better at it!

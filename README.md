[SquareEyes](https://cv-square-eyes.netlify.app/) is a fictional filmstreaming website that I worked on during my first year of Front-End Development at Noroff.

## Description

SquareEyes is a cross-course project that I worked on during my first year of Front-End Development at Noroff. It began with creating a design and wireframes in Figma, followed by building a fully responsive website using HTML and CSS. Additionally, JavaScript was incorporated to enhance interactivity, and content was fetched from a WordPress/WooCommerce REST API.
